* PROJ Write the brainslug backend in C++
** TODO Communicate with the frontend :frontend:
*** Ben and Matthias want to do the SC side using WebSockets, which means we need a TCP server. Find the best library for doing this
**** DONE Try Boost.Asio
***** Since we need to handle HTTP, asio is a bit too low-level. Currently trying out pion-net. Looks promising.
**** DONE Fix weird malloc-related crash when specifying a port number on the command line :bugs:
***** Not really a bug. Forgot to switch from gcc 4.5 back to llvm-gcc 4.2
**** TODO Decide on some sort of formal protocol.
       - Need a version number of the serialization format to ensure data integrity
       - What serialization format to use? 
	 + JSON
	 + Plists
	 + Binary
	 + Something else
       - Should under no circumstances assume that the frontend is using JavaScript in case we ever have to change this or add a 2nd frontend
**** DONE Get rid of the hardcoded JSON data in MoviesResourceHandler etc. and use a real database for storing this info  :model: 
**** DONE Move all the common code from the test db classes into a base, TestDB, that derives from DB. Change it to read the JSON
          in from a textfile instead of being hardcoded in C++. That should make it much simpler to modify the content and also
	  add test databases for episodes, seasons, etc. in the future
**** DONE Implement seasons support
**** TODO Implement episodes support
** TODO Communicate with the scrape server :scrape:
*** No clue yet, but since the server hasn't even been started, this isn't a pressing issue.
** TODO Store the cached scrape data in some kind of model :model:
*** SQLite backend? A real database?
** TODO Better configure/make scripts for detecting missing dependencies like Boost 1.43 and checking if pion-net and cajun are
        already installed
