* PROJ Write the brainslug backend in C++
** TODO Communicate with the frontend
*** Ben and Matthias want to do the SC side using WebSockets, which means we need a TCP server. Find the best library for doing this
**** TODO Try Boost.Asio
**** DONE Fix weird malloc-related crash when specifying a port number on the command line
***** Not really a bug. Forgot to switch from gcc 4.5 back to llvm-gcc 4.2
** TODO Communicate with the scrape server
*** No clue yet, but since the server hasn't even been started, this isn't a pressing issue.
** TODO Store the cached scrape data in some kind of model
*** SQLite backend? A real database?
