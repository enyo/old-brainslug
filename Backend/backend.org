* PROJ Write the brainslug backend in C++
** TODO Communicate with the frontend
*** Ben and Matthias want to do the SC side using WebSockets, which means we need a TCP server. Find the best library for doing this
**** DONE Try Boost.Asio
***** Since we need to handle HTTP, asio is a bit too low-level. Currently trying out pion-net. Looks promising.
**** DONE Fix weird malloc-related crash when specifying a port number on the command line :bugs:
***** Not really a bug. Forgot to switch from gcc 4.5 back to llvm-gcc 4.2
**** TODO Decide on some sort of formal protocol.
       - Need a version number of the serialization format to ensure data integrity
       - What serialization format to use? 
	 + JSON
	 + Plists
	 + Binary
	 + Something else
       - Should under no circumstances assume that the frontend is using JavaScript in case we ever have to change this or add a 2nd frontend 
** TODO Communicate with the scrape server
*** No clue yet, but since the server hasn't even been started, this isn't a pressing issue.
** TODO Store the cached scrape data in some kind of model
*** SQLite backend? A real database?
