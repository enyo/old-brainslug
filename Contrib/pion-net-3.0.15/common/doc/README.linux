Linux Build Instructions
========================

The Easy Way:
-------------

Atomic Labs has a tarball available from the "Third Party Libraries" page
on our website that contains all of the required libraries to build Pion
for certain versions of Redhat Linux.  To get started quickly, just download
and uncompress this file into your /usr/local/ directory, and you should be
able to skip down to the last step!


Installing ICU:
---------------

Boost requires the ICU library for i18n support.  This library is normally
pre-installed on Linux.  If you do not have it already, you should be able
to grab the latest version using your favorite package manager:

# yum install libicu libicu-devel
# up2date libicu libicu-devel


Installing Boost:
-----------------

Please see the README.boost file for instructions.

If you have an older version of Boost (pre-1.35) already installed, you will
likely will need to first uninstall it so that gcc and libtool do not get
confused:

# rpm -e boost boost-devel

If you're using RHEL/CentOS 4 (or earlier), please note that Boost 1.37.0 does
not seem to work with gcc 3.x.  You should use gcc4 instead:

# yum install gcc4 gcc4-c++

Before running "make" to build the Boost libraries, edit the
tools/build/v2/user-config.jam file and change this:

using gcc ;

to this:

using gcc : : g++4 ;


Installing zlib, bzlib & openssl:
---------------------------------

Pion requires zlib, bzlib and openssl for compression and SSL/TLS encryption
support, respectively.  These libraries are normally pre-installed on 
Linux. If you do not have them already, you should be able to use your 
favorite package manager (yum, up2date or aptget) to install the latest 
versions:

# yum install openssl openssl-devel zlib zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel bzip2-libs
# up2date openssl openssl-devel zlib zlib-devel bzip2 bzip2-devel bzip2-libs


Installing log4cplus:
---------------------

Note that the use of a logging framework is entirely optional, so you may
skip this step if you like.

We recommend that you use log4cplus for logging.  Please visit the
"Third Party Libraries" page on our website to obtain the source code
tarball for log4cplus.  Then, just run:

# tar xvfj log4cplus-<version>.tar.bz2
# cd log4cplus-<version>
# ./configure --enable-threads=yes
# make all
# make install


Installing libxml2:
-------------------

The Pion Platform requires the libxml2 development library for 
manipulating configuration files, and other things.  This library is not 
used by the Pion Network Library, so you may skip this step if you are 
only building the Network Library.

The libxml2 library is normally pre-installed on Linux.  If you do not 
have it already, you should be able to grab the latest version using 
your favorite package manager:

# yum install libxml2 libxml2-devel
# up2date libxml2 libxml2-devel


Installing Python:
------------------

Pion's PythonReactor requires Python version 2.4 or greater.  You may skip this
step if you do not want to build support for Python.

Python 2.4 (or greater) is already pre-installed and should work out of the box
on most Linux systems.  If you do not have it already, you should be able to
grab the latest version using your favorite package manager:

# yum install python python-devel
# up2date python python-devel

RHEL/CentOS 4 shipped with Python 2.3.  For this platform, we recommend that
you download, build and install Python 2.6 into your /usr/local directories.
You can download the source code from:

http://www.python.org

# tar xvfj Python-2.6.X.tar.bz2
# cd Python-2.6.X
# ./configure --with-threads
# make all
# make install

When you run the "configure" script for Pion, add the "--with-python" option
to use the new version installed in /usr/local/bin instead of the default one:

# ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python


Installing YAJL:
----------------

YAJL ("Yet Another JSON Library") is required to build support for the
JSONCodec plugin.  You may skip this step if you do not want to build
support for JSON.

To build YAJL, you must first have Ruby and CMake installed on your system. 
If you do not  have them already, you should be able to grab the latest
versions using your favorite package manager:

# yum install ruby cmake
# up2date ruby cmake

You can download the source code tarball for YAJL from the "Third Party
Libraries" page on our website.  After downloading it, just run:

# tar xvfz yajl-<version>.tgz
# cd yajl-<version>
# ./configure
# make

To install YAJL, we recommend that you just move the build files in the
"build/yajl-<version>" subdirectory into /usr/local:

# sudo mv build/yajl-<version>/lib/* /usr/local/lib
# sudo mv build/yajl-<version>/include/yajl /usr/local/include


Building and installing Pion:
-----------------------------

Now you should be able to build and install Pion:

# tar xvfz pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>.tar.gz
# cd pion-<PROJECT>-<VERSION>
# ./configure
# make all
# make install

To build and run Pion's unit tests, run "make check"

Note: if you're using RHEL/CentOS 4 with Boost 1.37.0 & gcc4, use:

# CC="gcc4" CXX="g++4" ./configure ...


Known Problems
--------------

The Pion executables may complain about loading shared libraries if the
Boost and/or other libraries are not in your search path.  Try this:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
