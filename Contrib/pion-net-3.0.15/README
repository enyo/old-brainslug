For logging, Pion may be configured to:

a) use std::cout and std::cerr for logging (the default configuration)
b) use one of the following open source libraries: log4cxx, log4cpp or
   log4cplus (configure using one of --with-log4cxx, --with-log4cpp or
   --with-log4cplus, respectively; also may be auto-detected)
c) disable logging entirely (configure --disable-logging)
